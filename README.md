# Dataset Repository
This repository contains a comprehensive dataset of 200 images featuring whiteflies in a tomato greenhouse. The images were captured under varying light exposures and lens focuses, offering variability in the scenarios.

## Structure

The dataset is organized as follows:

### Annotations

There are two types of annotations: Human and Machine Enhanced. 

The human annotations were made by a human and are therefore prone to error: whiteflies may be missed, others incorrectly annotated, and inaccuracies may exist in the bounding boxes.

The machine-enhanced annotations are predictions made by an ML model.
